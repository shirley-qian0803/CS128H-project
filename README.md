## Project Introduction

We are going to build a classic 2D game known as Pac-Man. We want to realize the basic playing rules and playing methods of Pac-Man. We want to devise the network functionality for Pac-Man as well.

## Technical Overview
We want to utilize some libraries in Rust to help develop this game, for example, bracket_lib. There are many functions that helps build the fundamental blocks of our game, such as tick function, main_loop function and some pathfinding algorithms. We will use the tick function and main_loop function to handle the game state of Pac-Man. We will implement pathfinding algotithms for the ghost characters.

For checkpoint 1 we plan to ...

For checkpoint 2 we plan to ...

## Possible Challenges

Learning and fully mastering the methods provided by bracket_lib will definitely take some time. The game Pac-Man consists of a lot of components which can be hard to handle properly.
